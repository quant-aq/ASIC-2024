# ASIC-2024

> ðŸš§ This document will be updated continuously prior to the live tutorial on April 30th, 2024.  


This repo serves as the primary record and Q+A forum for the pre-conference training titled "Python Packages" during the "Hands-on with data (coding workshop)" section. The tutorial is led by Dr. David H. Hagan and Jared Briskman of QuantAQ, Inc.


The goal of this session is to leave with an understanding of the tools available to make publication-quality air sensor figures using Python and how to use them.



## The official description:

| Preparing visually appealing and scientifically valid figures is crucial for ensuring positive outcomes for communities and scientists alike when using air sensors. In attending this tutorial, you will learn how to make puplication-quality figures to communicate the air sensor data you've collected for use in presentations, reports, and more. This session focuses on using the open-source programming language, python, to visualize data effectively. We will cover how to prepare your data and munge it into the correct format, create common figures, and use the `atmospy` python library to make your data visualization life easier.


## Pre-Conference Work

### Installation of atmospy

We ask that prior to attending the conference training session, you install `atmospy` and its dependencies following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://dhhagan.github.io/atmospy/index.html).


If you have any issues with installation, please open an issue on this repository. 

### Bring your own data (if you'd like to)

There will be opportunities during the training to try making figures using your own data. Please feel free to come prepared with your own data in csv (or similar tabular) format. Your data should be air quality or air sensor data and should be a time-series. Otherwise, there are no additional requirements!
